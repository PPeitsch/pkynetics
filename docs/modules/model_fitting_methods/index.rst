Overview
--------

This module provides implementations of several widely used model fitting methods in thermal analysis kinetics. These methods are used to determine kinetic parameters such as activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and reaction order from experimental data.

Key Features:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Implementation of popular model fitting methods
- Support for both isothermal and non-isothermal kinetics
- Robust error handling and input validation
- Calculation of goodness-of-fit parameters (e.g., R-squared)
