Overview
--------

This module provides implementations of model-free (isoconversional) methods for kinetic analysis. These methods allow for the determination of activation energy as a function of conversion without assuming a specific reaction model.

Key Features:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Implementation of popular isoconversional methods
- Support for multiple heating rate experiments
- Calculation of activation energy as a function of conversion
- Robust error handling and input validation
