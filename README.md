# Pkynetics

Pkynetics is a comprehensive library for thermal analysis kinetic methods, including traditional model-fitting and model-free methods, advanced computational techniques, machine learning approaches, and result visualization.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and import from various thermal analysis instruments
- Model-fitting methods (Avrami, Kissinger, Coats-Redfern, etc.)
- Model-free (isoconversional) methods (Friedman, OFW, KAS, Vyazovkin, etc.)
- Advanced methods (Starink, Master Plot, DAEM, etc.)
- Machine learning approaches for kinetic analysis
- Result visualization and statistical analysis
- Parallel processing capabilities

## Requirements

Pkynetics requires Python 3.8 or later. It has been tested with Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

## Installation

You can install Pkynetics using pip:
