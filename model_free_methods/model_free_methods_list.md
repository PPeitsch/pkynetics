# Model-Free Methods for Kinetic Analysis

1. **Friedman Method**: A differential isoconversional method that uses the logarithm of the reaction rate versus the reciprocal of the absolute temperature at constant extents of conversion.

2. **Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW) Method**: An integral isoconversional method that uses the logarithm of the heating rate versus the reciprocal of the absolute temperature at constant extents of conversion.

3. **Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) Method**: An improved integral isoconversional method that provides better accuracy than OFW, especially at higher heating rates.

4. **Vyazovkin Method**: An advanced isoconversional method that uses numerical integration to improve accuracy, especially for complex, multi-step reactions.

5. **Starink Method**: A modification of the KAS method that aims to provide improved accuracy over a wider range of activation energy and heating rate values.

6. **Miura-Maki Method**: A method based on the distributed activation energy model (DAEM) that can handle complex reactions with a distribution of activation energies.

7. **Master Plots Method**: A model-free method that compares the experimental data with theoretical master plots to determine the most likely reaction mechanism.

These methods will be implemented in order, starting with the Friedman method.
